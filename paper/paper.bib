abstract = {Modern high-throughput sequencing technologies provide low-cost microbiome survey data across all habitats of life at unprecedented scale. At the most granular level, the primary data consist of sparse counts of amplicon sequence variants or operational taxonomic units that are associated with taxonomic and phylogenetic group information. In this contribution, we leverage the hierarchical structure of amplicon data and propose a data-driven, parameter-free, and scalable tree-guided aggregation framework to associate microbial subcompositions with response variables of interest. The excess number of zero or low count measurements at the read level forces traditional microbiome data analysis workflows to remove rare sequencing variants or group them by a fixed taxonomic rank, such as genus or phylum, or by phylogenetic similarity. By contrast, our framework, which we call trac (tree-aggregation of compositional data), learns data-adaptive taxon aggregation levels for predictive modeling making user-defined aggregation obsolete while simultaneously integrating seamlessly into the compositional data analysis framework. We illustrate the versatility of our framework in the context of large-scale regression problems in human-gut, soil, and marine microbial ecosystems. We posit that the inferred aggregation levels provide highly interpretable taxon groupings that can help microbial ecologists gain insights into the structure and functioning of the underlying ecosystem of interest.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we provide an algorithm for solving constrained composite primal--dual monotone inclusions, i.e., monotone inclusions in which a priori information on primal--dual solutions is represented via closed and convex sets. The proposed algorithm incorporates a projection step onto the a priori information sets and generalizes methods proposed in the literature for solving monotone inclusions. Moreover, under the presence of strong monotonicity, we derive an accelerated scheme inspired on the primal--dual algorithm applied to the more general context of constrained monotone inclusions. In the particular case of convex optimization, our algorithm generalizes several primal--dual optimization methods by allowing a priori information on solutions. In addition, we provide an accelerated scheme under strong convexity. An application of our approach with a priori information is constrained convex optimization problems, in which available primal--dual methods impose constraints via Lagrange multiplier updates, usually leading to slow algorithms with unfeasible primal iterates. The proposed modification forces primal iterates to satisfy a selection of constraints onto which we can project, obtaining a faster method as numerical examples exhibit. The obtained results extend and improve several results in the literature.},

    Abstract = {Compositional data sets are ubiquitous in science, including geology, ecology, and microbiology. In microbiome research, compositional data primarily arise from high-throughput sequence-based profiling experiments. These data comprise microbial compositions in their natural habitat and are often paired with covariate measurements that characterize physicochemical habitat properties or the physiology of the host. Inferring parsimonious statistical associations between microbial compositions and habitat- or host-specific covariate data is an important step in exploratory data analysis. A standard statistical model linking compositional covariates to continuous outcomes is the linear log-contrast model. This model describes the response as a linear combination of log-ratios of the original compositions and has been extended to the high-dimensional setting via regularization. In this contribution, we propose a general convex optimization model for linear log-contrast regression which includes many previous proposals as special cases. We introduce a proximal algorithm that solves the resulting constrained optimization problem exactly with rigorous convergence guarantees. We illustrate the versatility of our approach by investigating the performance of several model instances on soil and gut microbiome data analysis tasks.},

@article{Jeon:2020,
abstract = {We consider the LASSO estimator for compositional data in which covariates are nonnegative, and their sum is always one. Due to the linear constraint of the regression coefficients caused by the sum to one condition, standard algorithms for LASSO cannot be applied directly to compositional data. Hence, a specific regularized regression model with linear constraints is commonly used. However, linear constraints incur additional computational time, which becomes severe in high-dimensional cases. Additionally, the exact computation for the regression is not investigated under existing methods. In this paper, we first propose an exact solution path algorithm for a l1 regularized regression with high-dimensional compositional data and extend to a classification model. We also compare its computational speed with that of previously developed algorithms and then apply the proposed algorithm to analyzing income inequality data in economics and human gut microbiome data in biology. By analyzing simulated and real data sets, we illustrate that our specialized algorithm is significantly more efficient than the generalized LASSO algorithm for compositional data.},

  abstract = {Summary.  Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

@article{Mishra2019,
abstract = {Many high-throughput sequencing data sets in biology are compositional in nature. A prominent example is microbiome profiling data, including targeted amplicon-based and metagenomic sequencing data. These profiling data comprises surveys of microbial communities in their natural habitat and sparse proportional (or compositional) read counts that represent operational taxonomic units or genes. When paired measurements of other covariates, including physicochemical properties of the habitat or phenotypic variables of the host, are available, inference of parsimonious and robust statistical relationships between the microbial abundance data and the covariate measurements is often an important first step in exploratory data analysis. To this end, we propose a sparse robust statistical regression framework that considers compositional and non-compositional measurements as predictors and identifies outliers in continuous response variables. Our model extends the seminal log-contrast model of Aitchison and Bacon-Shone (1984) by a mean shift formulation for capturing outliers, sparsity-promoting convex and non-convex penalties for parsimonious model selection, and data-driven robust initialization procedures adapted to the compositional setting. We show, in theory and simulations, the ability of our approach to jointly select a sparse set of predictive microbial features and identify outliers in the response. We illustrate the viability of our method by robustly predicting human body mass indices from American Gut Project amplicon data and non-compositional covariate data. We believe that the robust estimators introduced here and available in the R package RobRegCC can serve as a practical tool for reliable statistical regression analysis of compositional data, including microbiome survey data.},
